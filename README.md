### 👤 About Me
I was born and raised in Toronto, where I’ve always had a passion for video games and computers. When I’m not coding, you can find me outdoors cycling, running, or birding. I'm especially involved in bird conservation, volunteering with FLAP to help rescue and protect migratory birds during their seasonal travels.

Music has always been a big part of my life, I’ve been playing the **piano** for 11 years and the **trombone** for 9 years (mostly 1st trombone but am currently working on my lower range on 3rd). I play with the **North Toronto Community Band**, and it’s one of my favourite ways to stay connected with music and my community.
